There is no premium for Part A, but there are costs for you. Medicare supplement insurance and Medicare Advantage plans can help with these costs.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part B helps pay for physician expenses. There is a premium, a deductible, and other costs for Part B. Medicare supplement insurance and Medicare Advantage plans can help with these costs.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medicare Parts A and B are sometimes referred to as Traditional Medicare or Fee for Service Medicare. If you would like more coverage than Medicare Part A and Part B provide, you might be interested in a Medicare supplement insurance policy from an insurance company.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part C is also known as Medicare Advantage. You can sign up for a Medicare Advantage plan through an insurance company. Medicare Advantage plans generally have low or no premium but do have copays and network restrictions. You must also continue to pay your Part B premium. You do not need both a Medicare Advantage and a Medicare supplement insurance plan. You only ever need one or the other.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medicare Part D is the portion of Medicare that handles prescription drug coverage. You can sign up for a Part D plan through an insurance company. There will be a premium and some copays.&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;relatedQuestions&quot;:[&quot;do-i-need-additional-coverage&quot;,&quot;what-is-the-difference-between-medicare-supplement-insurance-and-medicare-advantage&quot;,&quot;do-i-qualify-for-medicare&quot;],&quot;dataInHead&quot;:{&quot;metaKeywords&quot;:&quot;what is Medicare, what, Medicare, health, insurance, supplement, advantage, part, a, b, c, d, traditional, fee for service&quot;,&quot;metaDescription&quot;:&quot;Medicare is a federal health insurance program provided to people that are 65 or older.

Frequently, benefits for Part D (see below) are also included&lt;\/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Part D \u2013 Prescription Drugs. This pays for prescription drugs. You share in the cost with copays.

There is no premium for Part A, but there are costs for you. Medicare supplement insurance and Medicare Advantage plans can help with these costs.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part B helps pay for physician expenses. There is a premium, a deductible, and other costs for Part B. Medicare supplement insurance and Medicare Advantage plans can help with these costs.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medicare Parts A and B are sometimes referred to as Traditional Medicare or Fee for Service Medicare. If you would like more coverage than Medicare Part A and Part B provide, you might be interested in a Medicare supplement insurance policy from an insurance company.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part C is also known as Medicare Advantage. You can sign up for a Medicare Advantage plan through an insurance company. Medicare Advantage plans generally have low or no premium but do have copays and network restrictions. You must also continue to pay your Part B premium. You do not need both a Medicare Advantage and a Medicare supplement insurance plan. You only ever need one or the other.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medicare Part D is the portion of Medicare that handles prescription drug coverage. You can sign up for a Part D plan through an insurance company. There will be a premium and some copays.&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;relatedQuestions&quot;:[&quot;do-i-need-additional-coverage&quot;,&quot;what-is-the-difference-between-medicare-supplement-insurance-and-medicare-advantage&quot;,&quot;do-i-qualify-for-medicare&quot;],&quot;dataInHead&quot;:{&quot;metaKeywords&quot;:&quot;what is Medicare, what, Medicare, health, insurance, supplement, advantage, part, a, b, c, d, traditional, fee for service&quot;,&quot;metaDescription&quot;:&quot;Medicare is a federal health insurance program provided to people that are 65 or older.

This program delivers benefits through private managed care networks, like a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) or Health Maintenance Organization (HMO). They include Part A and Part B benefits. They may also pay for essentials not covered by Medicare, like hearing aids and dental care. Frequently, benefits for Part D (see below) are also included&lt;\/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Part D \u2013 Prescription Drugs. This pays for prescription drugs. You share in the cost with copays.

There is no premium for Part A, but there are costs for you. Medicare supplement insurance and Medicare Advantage plans can help with these costs.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part B helps pay for physician expenses. There is a premium, a deductible, and other costs for Part B. Medicare supplement insurance and Medicare Advantage plans can help with these costs.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medicare Parts A and B are sometimes referred to as Traditional Medicare or Fee for Service Medicare. If you would like more coverage than Medicare Part A and Part B provide, you might be interested in a Medicare supplement insurance policy from an insurance company.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part C is also known as Medicare Advantage. You can sign up for a Medicare Advantage plan through an insurance company. Medicare Advantage plans generally have low or no premium but do have copays and network restrictions. You must also continue to pay your Part B premium. You do not need both a Medicare Advantage and a Medicare supplement insurance plan. You only ever need one or the other.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medicare Part D is the portion of Medicare that handles prescription drug coverage. You can sign up for a Part D plan through an insurance company.

Medicare Parts A and B are handled through the government. Medicare Part C is another name for Medicare Advantage, which is optional insurance you can get through an insurance company. Medicare Part D is the drug coverage portion of Medicare.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medicare supplement is insurance coverage that is defined by the government. There are different Medicare supplement insurance plans (Plan A through Plan N). Because Medicare supplement insurance plans are defined by the government, a specific plan, like Medicare supplement Plan F, will offer the same basic benefits no matter what company you purchase it from. (Some companies may introduce small additional features like gym memberships, but all health care benefits are the same.

In addition, you pay a monthly premium which is set by the federal government each year&lt;\/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Part A and B together are sometimes called \&quot;traditional medicare\&quot; or \&quot;original Medicare\&quot;&lt;\/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Part C \u2013 Medicare Advantage Program. This program delivers benefits through private managed care networks, like a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) or Health Maintenance Organization (HMO). They include Part A and Part B benefits. They may also pay for essentials not covered by Medicare, like hearing aids and dental care. Frequently, benefits for Part D (see below) are also included&lt;\/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Part D \u2013 Prescription Drugs. This pays for prescription drugs. You share in the cost with copays.

There is no premium for Part A, but there are costs for you. Medicare supplement insurance and Medicare Advantage plans can help with these costs.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part B helps pay for physician expenses. There is a premium, a deductible, and other costs for Part B. Medicare supplement insurance and Medicare Advantage plans can help with these costs.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medicare Parts A and B are sometimes referred to as Traditional Medicare or Fee for Service Medicare. If you would like more coverage than Medicare Part A and Part B provide, you might be interested in a Medicare supplement insurance policy from an insurance company.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part C is also known as Medicare Advantage. You can sign up for a Medicare Advantage plan through an insurance company. Medicare Advantage plans generally have low or no premium but do have copays and network restrictions. You must also continue to pay your Part B premium. You do not need both a Medicare Advantage and a Medicare supplement insurance plan. You only ever need one or the other.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medicare Part D is the portion of Medicare that handles prescription drug coverage. You can sign up for a Part D plan through an insurance company.

Think of this part as places, like a hospital, hospice or a skilled nursing facility (after a hospital stay). For most people, there is no monthly premium for this coverage. But you may have deductibles and copayment for certain hospital expenses&lt;\/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Part B \u2013 Medical Insurance. Think of this part as people, like doctors or specialists. This pays for outpatient care at clinics and doctors' offices. You pay a copay of up to 20 percent. In addition, you pay a monthly premium which is set by the federal government each year&lt;\/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Part A and B together are sometimes called \&quot;traditional medicare\&quot; or \&quot;original Medicare\&quot;&lt;\/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Part C \u2013 Medicare Advantage Program. This program delivers benefits through private managed care networks, like a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) or Health Maintenance Organization (HMO). They include Part A and Part B benefits. They may also pay for essentials not covered by Medicare, like hearing aids and dental care. Frequently, benefits for Part D (see below) are also included&lt;\/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Part D \u2013 Prescription Drugs. This pays for prescription drugs. You share in the cost with copays. This coverage is not required but is strongly recommended.
