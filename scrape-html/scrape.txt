How to get file size in Python?






Last Updated : 
21 Jan, 2021





We can follow different approaches to get the file size in Python. It’s important to get the file size in Python to monitor file size or in case of ordering files in the directory according to file size. 
Method 1: Using getsize function of os.path module
This function takes a file path as an argument and it returns the file size (bytes). 
Example:


Python3







filter_none

 edit
close

 play_arrow

 link
brightness_4
code











# approach 1
# using getsize function os.path module
import os
 
file_size = os.path.getsize('d:/file.jpg')
print("File Size is :", file_size, "bytes")










chevron_right



filter_none




Output:
File Size is : 218 bytes
Method 2: Using stat function of the OS module
This function takes a file path as an argument (string or file object) and returns statistical details about file path given as input. 
Example:


Python3







filter_none

 edit
close

 play_arrow

 link
brightness_4
code











# approach 2
# using stat function of os module
import os
 
file_size = os.stat('d:/file.jpg')
print("Size of file :", file_size.st_size, "bytes")










chevron_right



filter_none




Output:
Size of file : 218 bytes
Method 3: Using File Object
To get the file size, follow these steps –

Use the open function to open the file and store the returned object in a variable.  When the file is opened, the cursor points to the beginning of the file.
File object has seek method used to set the cursor to the desired location. It accepts 2 arguments – start location and end location. To set the cursor at the end location of the file use method os.SEEK_END.
File object has tell method that can be used to get the current cursor location which will be equivalent to the number of bytes cursor has moved. So this method actually returns the size of the file in bytes.

Example:


Python3







filter_none

 edit
close

 play_arrow

 link
brightness_4
code











# approach 3
# using file object
 
# open file 
file = open('d:/file.jpg')
 
# get the cursor positioned at end
file.seek(0, os.SEEK_END)
 
# get the current position of cursor 
# this will be equivalent to size of file
print("Size of file is :", file.tell(), "bytes")










chevron_right



filter_none




Output:
Size of file is : 218 bytes
Method 4: Using Pathlib Module
The stat() method of the Path object returns st_mode, st_dev, etc. properties of a file. And, st_size attribute of the stat method gives the file size in bytes.
Example:


Python3







filter_none

 edit
close

 play_arrow

 link
brightness_4
code











# approach 4
# using pathlib module
from pathlib import Path
 
# open file
Path(r'd:/file.jpg').stat()
 
# getting file size
file=Path(r'd:/file.jpg').stat().st_size
 
# display the size of the file
print("Size of file is :", file, "bytes")
 
# this code was contributed by debrc

filter_none




Output:
Size of file is : 218 bytes
