I am wanting to create a simple message box in Tkinter that appears and displays the exact error message.  Could anyone direct me to how this might be 
 achieved in tkinter, I have not been able to find much on this topic.
E.g: 
I am wanting to add this with pyinstaller.  I suppose pyinstaller creates a text file and you can see in cmd before it closes, but it would be nice if a message box appear with exact traceerror.
check here for more info
This login system which will pop up messagebox when you provide wrong data for entry messagebox should be entered into the entry if not the messagebox will pop up prompting you an error as occured
