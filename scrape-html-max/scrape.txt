<p>Part A covers inpatient hospital care. While you are in the hospital, it covers everything that is crucial for your treatment. Like your medications, X-rays, lab tests, operations, and meals. It can also pay for necessary follow-ups to inpatient care like physical therapy or skilled home nurse care.

<p>Part B covers doctor’s care when you’re sick or have a medical condition. It pays for outpatient hospital and clinic care, lab tests, and some nursing care at home if you’re homebound. Part B generally makes it easier to get preventative care, including things like your annual wellness exam, preventative screenings, and yearly flu shots.  It can cover the medical equipment you need for your home. And it can cover you if you have to go to the Emergency Room. It also covers most doctor services while you’re in the hospital.</p><p>The federal government provides Part B, and you’ll have to pay a monthly premium.

<p>Medicare Advantage combines the coverage of Part A and B – Original Medicare, plus extra benefits. Many plans include prescription drug coverage as well as dental and vision care. Some plans have no copays for most labs or tests. And some even have extra benefits like gym memberships and transportation.</p><p>Most plans offer $0 premiums, but you do have to pay your Part B premium. Most plans have copays for treatment. And you’ll continue to pay your Part B premium. Medicare Advantage plans have a yearly limit for out-of-pocket costs you have to pay. Once you reach that amount, you won’t pay more for any of your Medicare costs, your plan will cover it. Different plans have different maximums.</p><p>Medicare Advantage plans work all by themselves. They replace Medicare Parts A and B and because of this all-in-one approach, you don't pair them with Medicare Supplement policies.</p>

<td class="Question" colspan="2">How do these plan types differ?</td>

<tr>
<td class="Answers">There are many ways a Medicare Advantage plan differs from Medicare Supplement. With Medicare Advantage, you will have an all-in-one plan with low or no monthly premiums, but you'll have higher out-of-pocket payments when you do use your health plan, though there are limits to how much you have to pay. Medicare Advantage plans are also affiliated with specific health provider networks, so you will be limited to doctors in these plans.</td>
<td class="Answers">There are many ways a Medicare Supplement plan differs from a Medicare Advantage one. With Medicare Supplement, you will pay higher monthly premiums but will have fewer out of pocket costs when you do use your health plan. Also, you are permitted to see any doctor who accepts Medicare.</td>
